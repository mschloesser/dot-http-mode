# dot-http mode

A simple convenience mode that wraps around [dot-http](https://github.com/bayne/dot-http) and makes working with files that comply with the [HTTP Request in Editor Specification](https://github.com/JetBrains/http-request-in-editor-spec) defined by JetBrains possible from within Emacs.

*Hint: I primarily built this mode in order to familiarize myself with Elisp development. Pull Requests that extend the mode, improve my code or teach me new things are highly welcome.*
